# Some 3d thing

I was interested in three.js and found a tutorial by Javascript Mastery to be useful in getting started.

Used vite and react (tsk no TS, slap on wrist...)

Example can be found `https://davethreejs.netlify.app/` some of the modals are large so may take a bit to load

## To run
Dev: `npm run dev`
